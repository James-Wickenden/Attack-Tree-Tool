tree changes:
    toolbar at top
    styling
    keyhandler for editing labels
    AND/OR overlay
    
attack tree logic:
    handling and creating AND/OR nodes -> add and/or overlay similar to add child overlay button?
    when adding a child, change attribute values to default (or can they have additive values themselves?- ask)
    add an attribute creator and editor
